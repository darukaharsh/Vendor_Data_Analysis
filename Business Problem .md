## Problem Statement
Retail and wholesale companies often struggle with maximising profitability due inefficiencies in inventory and sales management. Common issues include poor pricing strategies, slow inventory turnover, and over-reliance on certain vendors-all of which lead to sub-optimal financial performance. 

Addressing these challenges is essential for sustainable growth and competitive advantages. 


## Background Context
In today’s competitive market, retailers and wholesalers face pressure to maintain healthy profit margins while catering to dynamic customer preferences and fluctuating market conditions. Inefficient practices—such as outdated pricing, unsold stock piling up, or over-dependency on a narrow vendor base—can erode profits and weaken financial stability.

A data-driven approach to managing inventory and sales is increasingly vital for businesses seeking to thrive.


## Current Impact
- **Losses from Poor Inventory Turnover:** Excess stock leads to higher holding costs and potential write-offs, negatively affecting cash flow.
    
- **Inefficient Pricing:** Inflexible pricing strategies may result in lost sales opportunities or reduced profit margins.
    
- **Vendor Dependency Risks:** Reliance on few vendors can make the supply chain vulnerable, and may limit negotiating power.
    
- **Unidentified Brand Performance Issues:** Without granular analytics, brands that underperform go unnoticed and continue to drag down profitability.


## Root Cause Indicators
- Limited visibility into real-time sales and inventory analytics.
    
- Lack of structured assessments for vendor and brand performance.
    
- Absence of systematic strategies for adjusting pricing or promotion based on market data.
    
- Infrequent evaluation of bulk purchasing impacts and inventory turnover ratios.


## Desired Outcomes
- Identify underperforming brands and target them for promotional or pricing interventions.
    
- Discover top vendors driving both sales volume and gross profit.
    
- Quantify how bulk purchasing affects unit costs to inform future buying decisions.
    
- Improve inventory turnover, reducing carrying costs and excess stock.
    
- Analyze and respond to profitability variance between high and low performing vendors.
